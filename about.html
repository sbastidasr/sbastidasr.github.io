<b>ABOUT ME</b>
<p>
I am a Systems Engineer from Quito - Ecuador and, occasionally, downtown NYC! I've worked the last 5 years on web and mobile development, both full-time and consulting.
Currently, I am enojoying iOS development. I am especially interested in remote work.
</p>
<p>
I am focused on both development and design. I believe great software has to look great, to work great. I love to read, and learn. On my free time I make stuff, apps, games. Besides development, I am focused on business and making great products.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this blog is to share what I learn, so others will find it useful.
If you are interested in working together,  you can reach me sbastidasr@gmail.com
