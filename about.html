<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>
I am a Systems Engineer from Quito - Ecuador and, occasionally, downtown NYC! I've worked the last 6 years on web
and mobile development, both full-time and consulting. Currently, I am enjoying the best of JavaScript and iOS development.
I am especially interested in remote work.
</p>
<p>
I am focused on both development and design. I believe great software has to look great, to work great.
I love to read, and learn. On my free time I make stuff, apps, games. Besides development,
I am focused on business and making great products.
