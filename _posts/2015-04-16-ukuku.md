So, we made a prototype for an app a while ago. I hadn’t had the chance to upload the results, but here we go. The objective was to build an academic app to promote biodiversity in the Amazon Reainforest. We came up with Ukuku:

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ukuku/ukuku1.png" alt="Ukuku">
</a>

Integration with social networks to sign in and create user profiles:

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ukuku/ukuku2.png" alt="Ukuku">
</a>

Photo feed: preview the latest photos from species everywhere! Click on a photo to open and preview where the photo was taken. Click on the species name to get into more detail!

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ukuku/ukuku3.png" alt="Ukuku">
</a>

Species Detail: A bit of background on the name, size, diet, type and many other details about the species. Share your picture on social networks!

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ukuku/ukuku4.png" alt="Ukuku">
</a>

Explore for new species by location, type and name.

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ukuku/ukuku5.png" alt="Ukuku">
</a>

Special screens to upload, modify and create species.

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ukuku/ukuku7.png" alt="Ukuku">
</a>

We also included a user profile so you can know who uploaded which species. Plus, we inserted an interactive map to show where most pictures are taken.

</a>

Solutions to the given problems: 

1. The app has to work in the Amazon where there is no internet. We solved this by caching all fetched results into the device’s memory. Everything that is posted is now stored on the app until there is an available internet connection.

2. Create a self-regulated community. It is hard to create an academic app with a self-regulated community where anyone can post pictures. Here is what we came up with :

Every picture has a report error button.  It allows you to describe an error, that is sent to the owner of the photo for editing.

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ukuku/ukuku9.png" alt="Ukuku">
</a>

The app sends push notifications to the home screen of the user so they wan fix the error. But, what happens if the user leaves it as is? If a picture gets more than 4 reports and 7 days go by without fixing, the picture is reassigned to another user for mediation.
