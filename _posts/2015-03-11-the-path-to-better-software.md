Better software through better engineering.

It’s almost 2015 and Software-related positions are increasing at an amazing rate. There will be approximately an increase of 30% in jobs related to IT and only a 5% in increase in graduates in software engineering, computer science, and related careers. The decreasing distance between demand and offer makes the future amazing for anyone in the related careers. Better payments, lots and lots of perks, slides inside offices and healthcare for the whole family are awaiting the best engineers. Lots and lots of job offers are waiting for the best in the area. But what is the difference between someone who actually gets hired and a software aficionado? What is the difference between a senior level engineer and a common current programmer? With this series, I will try to bridge the gap between these. I will mark my path in becoming a better software engineer after obtaining my computer science and engineering degree.

I will cover the following aspects. If you are interested in becoming a better engineer and getting hired, follow all the steps. If not, follow the ones you are interested in.

1. Learning
2. algorithms
3. programming languages (Especially Ruby, Objective-C, Swift)
4. patterns
5. contests
6. open source
7. platforms
8. Documenting
9. better software design.
10. better software practices.
11. Better management.(scrum, tsp)
12. data science
13. Books.
14. misc.

As with everything in life, these paths are my opinion to becoming a better engineer and by no means is a definitive “How to get into Google” guide. It is a practice a lot, mess things up and learn from the experience. If you think any part of these articles is incorrect or can be improved, please contact me or send me a request on github. Everything will be free and open source.
