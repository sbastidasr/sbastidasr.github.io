What I got out of it.

As we move forward in the path to better software, reading has become one of the most important things to do. Practice makes perfect, yes. Implementing all sorts of algorithms makes you the wizard of that specific language. But it is reading that expands your mind on new concept. This time, its Joel on Software. Almost every programmer i know has heard of Joel’s blog. And yet, very few have actually read it deeply.

Better concepts, better software. Here’s what I got from reading the Joel on software blog.

**About:** Joel was in the military, he worked on microsoft, founded StackOverflow, FogCreek and wrote the programming blog, which is not maintained anymore.

**Rewriting Software:** The single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make is deciding to rewrite the code from scratch. The reason that they think the old code is a mess is: It’s harder to read code than to write it.

* Instead of throwing code, refactor. Move things to the right places
* Optimize for speed, but know 1% of the work gets you 99% of the bang
* If its ugly, refactor. Rename stuff.
* Old code works. Its better, its fixed. Use it

**The Steps to better code.** These are actually 12 questions to measure your software team. Here are the important concepts on each question.
1. Use git. Nothing bad has ever come out of version control.
2. Arrange so that you can deploy to production in one step.
3. Test the whole product every day so it doesn’t crash.
4. Get a bug database that includes:
  * complete steps to reproduce the bug
  * expected behavior
  * observed (buggy) behavior
  * who it’s assigned to
  * whether it has been fixed or not

5. Fix bugs before writing new code, otherwise your code will end up filled with bugs and it will be not deliverable.
6. Have a schedule, and to keep it up to date.
7. Write a spec for your programs.
8. Use the best available technology.
9. Get testers, don’t waste programmers on it.
10. Make candidates write code during their interview
11. Do usability testing on your software.

Quotes:

Customers Don’t Know What They Want. Stop Expecting Customers to Know What They Want.

Note: This post is not finished. I will continue to add to this post as I read Joel’s blog.
