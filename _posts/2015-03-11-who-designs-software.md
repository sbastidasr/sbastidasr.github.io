We are all designers.

Let’s start by defining the design parts that make up an app.

**App Design/Graphic Design:** means designing the visual part of the app, literally defining how buttons, screens, letters will look.

**UI/Ux** means designing the interactions an app will have with people.

**Product Design** This, actually, is very close to App Design, but it embraces design of the app as a more global perspective, instead of only screens.

**Software Design** is the process of design that creates a specification of a software artifact, intended to accomplish goals.

Software design usually involves solving problems and planning software solutions. This includes both low-level component and algorithm design and high-level, architecture design. It does:

1. Abstraction
2. Refinement
3. Modularity
4. Software Architecture
5. Control Hierarchy
6. Structural Partitioning
7. Data Structure
8. Software Procedure
9. Information Hiding

**Software architecture** means designing solutions that meet all the requirements. Designing performance, security and manageability.

**Software Engineering** Means design and development of high-quality standards. Usually, this part is a low-level component and algorithm design.

**Coding:** They have to code absolutely every part of the app and coding is: designing how a machine does something and telling the computer how to do it.As you can see, design shouldn’t end in the design phase of the software product lifecycle. Designers should be concerned with everything: from implementation to arts and graphic design, to the small changes made to add functionality afterwards. Software design should actually mean everything in the app.

Making software is an art.
